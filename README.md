# NLP - Natural Language Processing Repository

Welcome to the **NLP** repository! This repository contains various **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** projects, techniques, and implementations that can help you understand and work with text data. Whether you are new to NLP or an experienced practitioner, this repo has something for everyoneâ€”from beginner to advanced-level tasks.

## Overview

The **NLP** repository provides code, models, and explanations for different NLP tasks, including but not limited to:

- **Text Preprocessing**
- **Tokenization**
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**
- **Text Classification**
- **Part-of-Speech Tagging**
- **Language Modeling**
- **Word Embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe)**
- **Sequence-to-Sequence Models**
- **Text Generation**

Each project aims to demonstrate the application of different NLP techniques with practical examples, allowing for hands-on experimentation and exploration of various NLP models and algorithms.

## Features

- **End-to-End Solutions**: From data preprocessing to training and evaluation.
- **Model Implementations**: Code for popular models like **Word2Vec**, **BERT**, **GPT**, etc.
- **Pretrained Models**: Includes pretrained models to help you get started with little effort.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive tutorials that explain NLP concepts and tasks.
- **Datasets**: Curated datasets that you can use for training and testing your models.
